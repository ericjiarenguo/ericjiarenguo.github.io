        <section>
            <p>Hey! I am the creator of this website you are currently using. You might have come to be interested in who I am and why I‚Äôm doing this.  </p>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>My name is Eric Guo and I‚Äôm learning more about coding. I want to learn more about computers and programing since we will be using them a lot more often in the future. I‚Äôm currently 13 years old, attending 8th grade at St. Micheals College School. A few of my hobbies are coding, debating and competitive tennis.  </p>
            <h2>Coding</h2>
            <p>Ever since I got my very own computer, I‚Äôve always tried to find easier ways to use it and some keyboard shortcuts. I knew that coding and getting to know how to use computers will be extremely crucial for the future. Although self-teaching is an option, coding is a complicated thing to learn, so having a teacher is a lot more helpful than teaching yourself.  </p>
            <h2>Debate</h2>
            <p>I have debated for 2 years already at advanced level. I used to debate at VDA (Vancouver Debate Academy). Now, since my family and I moved to Toronto, we are trying to find a debate class that fits me well. However, I don't do many tournaments, since my schedule is well packed with tutor classes and tennis. Debate has become one of my favorite classes throughout my 2 years of learning this.  </p>
            <h2>Tennis</h2>
            <p>I have played tennis for 4 years and 2 years of competitive experience. I am a huge tennis player and dedicate a lot of my time to this sport. I was in the BC Provincial Teams in U12 and trying to push my way up to National Teams. I have played many tournaments and received a decent number of wins. I have learned through this sport that losing is not failing, it's experiences that you cannot gain in winning. One thing that my dad said to me that made me not quit in this sport during the hard times is, ‚ÄúLosing is not failing; quitting is. Thinking about the mistakes and correcting them in the next match is the best experience you can gain.‚Äù There was one time when it made me feel like I just wanted to quit and do something else. This was in September 2024, when I fractured my right elbow after a fall in tennis. As soon as I found out the news that I fractured my elbow and needed a cast for at least a month, it broke the inside of me for a few days, just thinking if I should continue. I eventually got my cast taken off and slowly recovered. The process took a while, because I have not played for a month. Whenever I feel like giving up, I think of this. I am almost entering my 2nd year in U14 and hoping to push up my rank and get recruited in the National Teams.  </p>
            <p>Now, that's a bit about me, and I hope you enjoy the website and it‚Äôs games üòä </p>
