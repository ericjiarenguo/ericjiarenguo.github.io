                <p>You may or may not have eaten something called Zongzi, a traditional dish in China that has a history of over 2,000 years, around 770-476 BC. It's used in a festival called Dragon Boat festival, also known as Duan Wu Festival. During the Dragon Boat Festival, there are dragon boat races, and mainly eating Zongzi. Now let's start talking a bit about where this festival originated and why did we have to eat sticky rice dumplings (Zongzi). </p>
                <p>There was a famous and well-admired poet called Qu Yuan. When the Chu capital fell to the Qin, Qu Yuan drowned himself in the Miluo River in despair. It is said that people raced out with dragon boats trying to save him. they also threw rice so it would prevent the fish eating his body. this festival ended up with eating Zongzi and racing in dragon boats commemorating his death.</p>
                <p>Now you know the brief history of Zongzi, you also need to know whatâ€™s in it. This is in most cases used as a dessert. However, it's not just sweet, there are some savory ones too. The sweet ones have red bean paste inside and the savory ones have meat or pork inside. the southern China is more popular with the savory taste, but in northern China, they like it sweeter. Both are all really good, but it just depends on what you prefer. I like the sweeter one more, especially putting a bit of white sugar beside it and then dipping it in.</p>
